#### CodePilot Prompt

"""
You are tasked with scaffolding a TypeScript-based browser game using Webpack, Yarn, and Three.js. The game is a dice-based strategy game featuring the following requirements:

1. **Core Systems**:

   - Object-oriented structure with classes for "Dice" and "Abilities".
   - Abilities are dynamically loaded from JSON files, using a generic interface to allow future data source changes.

2. **Testing**:

   - Test-driven development setup using Jest, with mocks to isolate individual classes during tests.

3. **Persistence**:

   - A system to save player data, supporting file system API, browser storage, and a default discard behavior.

4. **UI**:

   - Touch-friendly menus for "Main Menu," "Game Settings" (with Controls, Audio, Video tabs), and "Help Menu."

5. **Performance**:

   - Emphasis on smooth performance, optimized for low-tier hardware and mobile devices.

Generate the full project structure, including sample code for the above systems and configurations for Webpack and Jest.
