make a threejs scene where I shake the dice with my mouse, holding down mouse 1,
and throw the dice when I realease mouse1

I should be able to influence both the volatility and the direction of the dice with my shaking

I hit spacebar and it falls (parabolically) from above and behind me
affected by gravity
(gravity abilities would be a good idea)
(obviously not real physics. faux physics)
